## Ludovic Logiou @Krast @Krast76
A Site Reliability Engineer working day to day with Kubernetes and a lot of Cloud Native projects (such as Rook, Prometheus, Thanos…). 
He is based in Paris and he contributes as often as he can on open source projects that’s why he became a proud member of the French Glossary Localisation effort from the beginning.
